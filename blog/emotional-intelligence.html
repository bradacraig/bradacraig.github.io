      <h4>What Is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-text">Emotional Intelligence (EQ): </span>Emotional
        Intelligence, or EQ, is the ability to recognise, understand, manage,
        and express emotions effectively. It involves skills like
        self-awareness, empathy, and social awareness, enabling us to navigate
        emotional situations, build relationships, and make good decisions.
      </p>
      <h4>Difference between EQ and IQ</h4>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-text">EQ: </span>Refers to emotional abilities, social
        skills, and understanding the emotions of yourself and others. It
        includes empathy, emotional regulation, and motivation. It is useful for
        navigating interpersonal relationships and conflict resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-text">IQ: </span>Is a measure of cognitive and
        intellectual skills like logical reasoning, problem-solving, and the
        ability to retain knowledge. It assesses abilities related to learning,
        understanding, and applying information to tasks
      </p>
      <h4>Importance Of EQ</h4>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-text">Finding Enjoyment and Success in Life: </span
        >Strong emotional Intelligence has been linked to positive life
        outcomes, job success, relationship satisfaction, stress tolerance, and
        overall well-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-text">Workplace Success: </span>A robust EQ is crucial
        for effective leadership, teamwork, conflict resolution, and
        communication. People with high EQ are often great leaders and team
        players due to their ability to understand, empathise, and connect with
        others.
      </p>
      <h4>My Own Experience With Emotional Intelligence</h4>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-text">Learning to Listen: </span>I would count being a
        good listener as one of my stronger traits. I often prefer to let
        someone else speak first and then respond. However, the practice of
        dedicated active listening is a practice that felt relatively new to me,
        I guess it's more something I've never thought deeply about. I enjoyed
        the practice and can see how it will become very useful when working
        with a team and attempting to solve problems. It can be tempting to rush
        in with what you think might be the best solution, while instead
        actively listening to others views and solutions may yeild a more
        rounded and robust way to solve a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-text">Reading the Room: </span>Over the years I've
        held down many odd jobs and also entertained crowds big and small with
        music. One of the most important things I have learned is the ability to
        be able to read the room and to respond appropriately to a given
        situation. When managing a stressful cafe I had to learn to control my
        emotions when the going got tough. The old adage "the customer is always
        right" often came to mind. Somtimes you really didn't want to remake a
        perfectly good coffee for a pedantic customer while in the middle of a
        busy rush, but being able to understand feelings of anger and
        frustration in a stressful situation, and to then supress those negative
        emotions and replace them with a smile and understanding can be the
        difference between a successful day and the wheels completely flying
        off.
