        <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is a way of retraining our brains to be more malleable
          when learning. It is directly related to how we practice and learn new
          skills by forming stronger pathways between neurons in the brain.

            Practice makes permanent. The more times the network is stimulated,
            the stronger and more efficient it becomes.

        <p>
          By engaging in meaningful practice everyday we can increase our
          neuroplasticity.
        </p>
        <h4>The Benifits of Neuroplasticity and How We Can Engage With It</h4>
        <p>
          Once we understand the power and potential of neuroplasticity, we
          begin to remove the preconceptions that we are "not smart enough" or
          "too old" to learn and accept that meaningful, deep learning is
          absolutely possible at any stage of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          One way I can engage with neuroplasticity for my own benefit is to
          engage in meaningful, regular practice. I have already begun this
          process in a small way by attempting to improve my typing skills with
          the hope of increasing my speed and accuracy. I never really learned
          to touch type properly and it has always bothered me, for a while I
          thought it may be a skill I might never actually pick up. Through my
          understanding of neuroplasticity and engaging in meaningful, regular
          practice every day I have already begun to see results. Little
          victories like this give me confidence that I will be able to learn
          more complex concepts throughout the Dev Academy course and hopefully
          throughout the rest of my life.
        </p>
        <h4>How Can We Increase Neuroplasticity?</h4>
        <p>
          Meaningful, regular practice helps strengthen existing pathways
          related to skills we already possess, while the same approach can help
          create new pathways to help us develop new skills or repair and
          recover from an injury or trauma.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a similar vein, we can retrain our brain to have a more positive
          outlook simply by recognising negative thoughts and feelings when they
          arise and replacing them with positive ones. This can help give us
          confidence and can aid in further learning. If we don't encourage and
          strengthen the neuro pathways we want, we loose them. The inverse of
          this can also be true when developing bad habits and addictions.

          was an interesting insight into how neuroplasticity affects physical
          rehab and how the same principles can be applied to mindset.
        </p>
        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p>
          A fixed mindset and a growth mindset are two contrasting beliefs about
          one's abilities and talents. A fixed mindset is the belief that
          intelligence and talents are static (fixed) and cannot be changed,
          leading to a defensive, negative, and defeatist approach when faced
          with challenges or failures. On the other hand, a growth mindset is
          the belief that intelligence and talents can be developed through
          effort and actions, promoting a positive, persevering, and inquisitive
          attitude towards learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          These two mindsets are extremely valuable to understand when learning
          new skills as it can better help us to manage failures and setbacks by
          reminding us that we are able to switch up our mindsets to be more
          growth focused.
        </p>
        <h4>Exploring a Growth Mindset</h4>
        <p>
          While exploring these mindsets I found it interesting that pure belief
          in one's abilities can have a big effect on how we learn. It opens up
          possibilities and makes difficult tasks seem a lot more achievable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have definitely been guilty of slipping into a fixed mindset from
          time to time, particularly when it comes to how I let music and being
          a musician define my life. There was a point where I felt that I was
          unable to do anything else and that all other doors had closed. By
          adopting a growth mindset and convincing myself that I was still
          absolutely able to learn new skills I found the confidence to begin
          learning to code which has in turn led me to study at Dev Academy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will continue to integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey
          by embracing challenges, persisting in the face of setbacks, learning
          from mistakes and criticism and by finding lessons and inspiration in
          the success of others.

          particularly interesting as it provided some great concise points and
          examples of a fixed vs growth mindset.
        </p>
        <h4>Integration with my Learning Plan</h4>
        <p>
          My understanding of neuroplasticity and a growth mindset will help me
          to achieve my goals laid out in my learning plan by reminding me that
          anything is possible with the right attitude and dedicated practice.
          By committing to regular, meaningful coding practice I will help
          create new neural pathways and strengthen existing ones. Two of my
          strengths laid out in my learning plan are positivity and
          determination. By reinforcing and continuing to practice these traits
          I will be developing my growth mindset which will further aid me on my
          learning journey.
