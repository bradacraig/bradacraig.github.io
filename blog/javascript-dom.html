      <h4>The Relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h4>
      <p>
        A good analogy for explaining the relationship between html, css and
        javascript is that of a car.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cars are complex machines and require all parts to be working
        harmoniously in order for it to function correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's start with HTML: Think of this as the chassis of the car, the raw
        steel and aluminium forged, pressed and assembled together to create the
        structure of the car. On it's own it sort of resembles a car but it's
        rather unattractive in its unfinished form and also wont get you very
        far without a few more working parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next up, CSS: This is what makes the car look good. The CSS property
        <code>background-color: red</code>
        is like the main colour of the cars exterior. Anything from how logos
        and text is displayed on the vehicle through to the overall size and
        shape of the car and elements associated with it can be thought of in
        the way that CSS styles a webpage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally we have JavaScript: What happens when I turn the key in my car?
        What happens when I press the accelerator or brake pedal? What about if
        there's a fault and that pesky air-bag light comes on? The process of
        instructions to make something happen on a car can be related to the way
        JavaScript makes a webpage interactive.
      </p>
      <p>
        To use a specific example lets look at starting a car. In basic terms,
        you turn the key which sends an electrical signal to the starter motor
        which in turn initiates the firing procedure for the engine. If we think
        of the key as a button on a webpage, we use JavaScript to listen for the
        click of the button and then execute a function (or series of functions)
        the return of the function is what we hope to get back at the end, in
        the case of the car, eventually we want the thing to start.
      </p>
      <h4>Control Flow and Loops</h4>
      <p>
        Imagine you're making breakfast, and you have a list of tasks to
        complete: brewing coffee, toasting bread, and frying eggs. This list
        represents a sequence of actions you need to take, much like the control
        flow in JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Control flow in JavaScript is like following a recipe step by step. You
        start with one instruction, move on to the next, and so on until you've
        completed all the tasks. If there are conditional steps, such as "if the
        coffee machine is on, brew coffee; otherwise, turn on the coffee machine
        first," that's similar to JavaScript's conditional statements, like
        <code>if</code> and <code>else</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next up is loops. Picture yourself folding laundry, and you have a pile
        of clothes to fold. You start with the first item, fold it neatly, then
        move on to the next item until you've folded all the clothes in the
        pile. This repetitive process of folding each item is like a loop in
        JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        In JavaScript, a loop allows you to repeat a block of code multiple
        times. Just like folding each piece of clothing in the laundry pile, you
        can iterate over a set of data or perform a task repeatedly until a
        certain condition is met. For example, if you have ten shirts to fold,
        you can use a loop
        <code>for(let i = 0; i &lt; shirts.length -1; i++)</code> to fold each
        shirt until you've folded all ten.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, in short, control flow is like following a recipe or a set of
        instructions sequentially, while loops are like repetitive tasks such as
        folding laundry or counting items in a list until you've completed a
        specific action.
      </p>
      <h4>The DOM</h4>
      <p>
        If we stick with our cooking analogy... Imagine you have a recipe book
        open in front of you. Each page of the book represents a different part
        of a meal you're preparing. The recipe book is a lot like a webpage, and
        each page is like an element on that webpage â€“ it could be a paragraph,
        an image, a heading, or a button.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DOM in JavaScript can be compared to your ability to interact with
        that recipe book. You can flip through the pages, find specific recipes,
        and make changes as needed. The DOM also represents the structure of a
        webpage as a tree-like hierarchy of elements, and JavaScript allows you
        to access and manipulate these elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, let's say you're browsing a webpage and you want to change
        the colour of a heading. Using JavaScript and the DOM, you could select
        that button element and then change its colour property with
        <code>document.getElementById('main-heading').style."blue"</code>
        It's like flipping to a specific page in the recipe book and physically
        highlighting the ingredients or name for a recipe.
      </p>
      <p>
        In simpler terms, the DOM is like the structure of a webpage, and
        JavaScript gives you the power to interact with and modify that
        structure, much like how you can navigate and make changes in a recipe
        book.
      </p>
      <h4>Arrays and Objects</h4>
      <p>
        Both arrays and objects are used to store and organise data, but they
        have different structures and ways of accessing that data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrays are lists of items stored in a specific order, where each item is
        identified by its position or index. You can think of an array like a
        numbered list, where you can access each item by its position in the
        list. For example, if you have an array of fruits like
        <code>["apple", "banana", "orange"]</code>, you can access "apple" with
        <code>array[0]</code>, "banana" with <code>array[1]</code>, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Objects store data as key-value pairs. Each piece of data is associated
        with a unique key, which acts like a label for that data. You can think
        of an object like a dictionary, where you look up information by its
        corresponding word (key). For example, if you have an object
        representing a person like
        <code>{ name: "Brad", age: 31, city: "Auckland"}</code>, you can access
        the person's name with <code>object.name</code>, their age with
        <code>object.age</code>, and their city with <code>object.city</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrays are good for storing lists of similar items, like a list of
        numbers or a shopping list, while objects are better for organising
        related data with different types of information, like details of a
        person or attributes of an object.
      </p>
      <h4>Functions</h4>
      <p>
        Functions are a useful piece of code for making something happen. They
        take in information or parameters and return a result depending on how
        and what is included inside the body of the function.
      </p>
      <p>
        On their own they don't do much, and so rely on something happening
        inside the body of the function (like a loop) to make them useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best part about functions is that they are reusable, meaning that we
        can write the instructions once and then "call" the function e.g
        <code>getRandomInt()</code> throughout our JavaScript file whenever we
        need that specific task done.
