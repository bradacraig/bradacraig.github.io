    <div class="container">
      <div class="positions-list">
        <div class="list-group">
          <div class="list-header">Static</div>
          <div class="list-content">
            <p>
              Elements with static positioning are displayed in the order they
              appear in the HTML document. This is the default position if no
              other positon is declared.
            </p>
            <p>
              They cannot be moved using top, bottom, left, or right properties.
            </p>
            <p>
              In other words, elements will stay where they are in the webpage
              flow. By flow we mean how they were originally written in the html
              structure.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="list-group">
          <div class="list-header">Relative</div>
          <div class="list-content">
            <p>
              Elements with relative can be nudged around from their original
              spot.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means that they can be moved from their default position
              using top, bottom, left, or right properties. However, they still
              occupy space in the normal flow of the document.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="list-group">
          <div class="list-header">Absolute</div>
          <div class="list-content">
            <p>
              Elements with absolute positioning are taken out of the normal
              flow of the document, and can be placed whereevr you want inside a
              container.
            </p>
            <p>
              They are positioned relative to their closest positioned ancestor
              (like for example the div or container that the element is nested
              inside) or the initial containing block (the enitre html
              document).
            </p>
            <h3>Here's an example of absolute positioning:</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="list-group">
          <div class="list-header">Fixed</div>
          <div class="list-content">
            <p>
              Elements with fixed positioning stay in one place on the screen
              even when you scroll.
            </p>
            <p>
              A good example of this is the navigation bar at the top of this
              page.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Here's what the CSS looks like for the nav bar with a fixed
              position:
            </h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="list-group">
          <div class="list-header">Sticky</div>
          <div class="list-content">
            <p>
              Elements with a sticky position act like relative until you scroll
              past a certain point, then they stick in place.
            </p>
            <p>In some ways its like a combination of Fixed and Relative.</p>
            <p>
              The headings for each section on this page have a sticky position.
              That's what makes them follow their content and then collapse into
              the next heading.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
