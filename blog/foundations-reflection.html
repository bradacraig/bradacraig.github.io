        <h4>
          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I notice when I slip into a fixed mindset now... This isn't
            necessarily a bad thing but it serves as a reminder that I might
            need to take a break and reevaluate.
          </li>
          <li>
            I struggled to talk about the more spiritual side of myself as it's
            not something I really practice or think about much.
          </li>
          <li>
            I work much better in the mornings and when I have a clear plan or
            goal for the day. I can become easily distracted and slip into
            procrastination if I lose focus.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Values can help guide our learning as they can provide insight into
          how we learn and what we can focus on to improve our learning. It can
          guide our learning style and allow us to learn more effectively either
          alone or in a group. In regards to programming, they can help guide a
          project to make sure that our values align with the requirements of
          the end-user and provide goals to strive for when developing in a
          team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Empathy can help us better relate and understand other people we are
          learning with, teachers, and even other people that support us while
          learning. It can help to remind us that we are not alone on this
          journey and that not everyone sees and experiences things the way we
          do. Being open to other people's experiences and emotions can enrich
          our learning and provide better outcomes for everyone. Empathy in
          programming can help us to think from the viewpoint of the end-user
          and to make sure they are accessible to a wide variety of users from
          different backgrounds or cultures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Self-awareness is important in learning as it enables us to recognise
          our strengths and weaknesses and how they influence our emotions and
          behaviour. By demonstrating self-awareness we can regulate our
          emotions, empathise with others, and make better decisions as a
          result. In programming being self-aware can help us to grow by
          understanding our strengths and weaknesses and allows us to be
          continuously improving and striving to be competitive and the best we
          can be.
        </p>
        <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
        <p>
          I was surprised at how deep it got into the psychology at times. This
          was by no means a negative thing and the fact that it was tied in with
          thinking about learning how to code made it more interesting.
        </p>
        <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I find writing about myself quite hard in general. I definitely hear
            the internal voice in my head criticising and cringing when trying
            to put words down. Sometimes it feels difficult to put into words
            exactly what or how I'm feeling.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trying to nail down my strengths and weaknesses was quite hard as
            it's not something I really think about a lot.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I think it is because a lot of the jobs in tech can be quite mentally
          demanding and having a good understanding of oneself and how you
          relate to others can help to make sure you don't burn out. Although a
          lot of the past month has been individual work, most of the jobs will
          require close collaboration and teamwork. Understanding and developing
          these core "soft" skills can help us to work better in these
          environments.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming
          instead? Justify your answer.
        </h4>
        <p>
          I don't think the core study is a waste of time, I'll be honest and
          say it's not exactly my favourite part of the course but I certainly
          understand its value when it comes to learning and practicing
          programming due to how communication-heavy the discipline is. I felt
          like I still had plenty of time to practice programming.
