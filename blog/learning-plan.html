      <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
      <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
      <p>
        My ultimate long term goal is a solid sustainable career in a tech
        related/adjacent industry. I'm not shooting for a job at meta or google,
        just something where I can use the skills I've developed at Dev Academy
        in a rewarding, interesting way. Eventually it would be great if this
        job had some remote work possibilities to allow me the flexibility to
        carry on with my musical projects as these are an important part of my
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the short term (6months - 1 year after course completion) I'm
        essentially open to absolutely anything within reason. During this time
        and even up to 2 years after course completion I'd like to find a job at
        a NZ based company and actually go into an office to do work. I feel
        this is important as I'd like to build my network and gain on the job
        experience as a junior developer before working towards a more flexible
        role.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, I'd like to find a job that will allow me to live comfortably
        and allow me the opportunity to buy a house and start a family.
      </p>
      <h4>Describe your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h4>
      <p>My strengths include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Positivity: I tend to have an optimistic, glass half full outlook
          which allows me to see the bright side of learning and to aim high and
          convince myself I'm able to solve a problem.
        </li>
        <li>
          Determination and Perseverance: I'm driven and motivated to get the
          job done.
        </li>
        <li>
          Curiosity and enthusiasm to learn: I’m thankful that I genuinely enjoy
          the learning process and look forward to developing new skills. I’m
          hoping that this will keep me motivated throughout the course and
          drive my learning journey.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>My limitations Include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Over excitement and over-engineering/perfectionism: I noticed this
          while building out the blog website in particular. I tend to get a bit
          carried away with a big picture idea and end up spending too much time
          on "nice to have but not essential" features. I need to practice
          better time management to get the minimum concept working first before
          investing time into making it perfect.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fear of failure and mistakes: Mistakes are going to be made somewhere
          along this learning journey, and I’m not always going to get it right
          the first time. However, I need to be mindful of this and accept that
          this is all part of the process, rather than letting the fear stop me
          from making progress. I think the idea of breaking problems down into
          smaller chunks and being methodical rather than trying to speed
          through tasks should help me here.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Time management: I'm getting better at this thanks to the pomodoro
          timer and time boxing, however I feel like I can still improve.
        </li>
        <li>
          Self-confidence: Often I will wait to let someone go first in case I'm
          wrong, I'd like to work on this to be able to share first and not
          worry if it might not be the perfect answer.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>My commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme.</h4>
      <p>I will strive to work productively and safely for myself by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Practising good time management by timing my focused work sessions
          with a pomodoro timer and taking frequent short breaks as to not burn
          myself out.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will break tasks down into smaller, more manageable chunks and aim
          to set achievable goals for each day.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will understand that there will be easy days and hard days and that
          this is normal. I will be grateful for when I pick something up
          quickly and try my best to not get disheartened when I struggle.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I will strive to work productively and safely with other learners by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Understanding that everyone is learning at a different pace and as a
          result I can't expect to be as fast or efficient as someone who is
          approaching this course with lots of experience under their belt. On
          the other hand, it is no use becoming frustrated with someone who has
          less experience than me and expect everyone to understand everything
          from the get go. The boat rises with the ocean, so I will try my best
          to offer help when I can and to ask for help when I need it.
        </li>
        <li>I will respect other learners personal culture and viewpoints.</li>
        <li>
          I will respect learning hours and not expect everyone to keep the same
          schedule as me.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I will strive to work productively and safely with
        facilitators/community representatives by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Respecting the opinions, views and advice given to me by
          facilitators/community representatives.
        </li>
        <li>
          Respecting the time that facilitators/community representatives are
          giving to me and understanding that they are not available at every
          hour of the day.
        </li>
        <li>
          Respecting the personal cultures and views of facilitators/community
          representatives.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>When things are starting to build up and get to me I will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Take a break: Leave the room, go for a walk or do some exercise. Try
          revisiting what is causing the build up with a fresh head.
        </li>
        <li>
          Try to explain what is causing the stress/build up first to myself
          (write it down, speak it out loud), then to a friend or fellow learner
          and or facilitator.
        </li>
        <li>
          Break the problem down to try and get some easy wins on the board to
          lift my mood.
        </li>
        <li>Not be afraid to admit I'm having a problem and ask for help.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I will strive to seek help in a timely way by:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Giving the problem an honest attempt on my own first and trying to
          pinpoint where I might be going wrong.
        </li>
        <li>
          Put my problem into words by asking the question on google or Chat
          GPT. With regards to Chat GPT I will write the prompt in a way that it
          will act as a tutor or mentor and help me to understand the problem
          I'm having.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reach out on the appropriate discord channel to see if fellow learners
          and or facilitators can help.
        </li>
        <li>
          DM a facilitator if I'm really struggling and need focused, specific
          help.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>What I expect from the Facilitation team:</h4>
      <p>
        I expect the facilitation team to be professional, knowledgable and
        patient. I expect them to be friendly and convivial when appropriate and
        to respect the different views, strengths and limitations of all of the
        learners. I expect them to be able to help where and when they can, but
        do not expect them to know everything and be available 24/7.
      </p>
      <h4>Scheduling information and commitments:</h4>
      <p>
        Currently I have a handful of specific dates that may clash with course
        time. I have tried my best to keep these to an absolute minimum. They
        are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>FRI APRIL 26 - SUN APRIL 28: Attending a wedding in Hawkes Bay.</li>
        <li>
          THU MAY 23: Mum's 60th. It would be nice to share dinner with her this
          evening but not essential if the bootcamp course requires me to work
          late that day.
        </li>
        <li>SAT MAY 25: Attending a wedding in Auckland.</li>
        <li>
          TUESDAY EVENINGS 7-9pm: Studio session with my band Flamingo Pier.
          This is able to be moved around and or skipped some weeks if needed.
          My bandmates understand that I've made a commitment to this course
          until July 12.
        </li>
