        Recently my band Mini Simmons was in the midst of organising our final
        show. We were selling tickets online via a service provided by a local
        venue and receiving daily updates on how we were tracking. Upon
        reviewing the breakdown of the costs we realised that the venue had
        accidentally been charging each purchaser an extra 10% due to GST being
        added twice. As far as the venue was concerned, they were still getting
        their cut so we technically could have just pocketed the money and
        carried on living. Ticket purchasers were also unaware as most would
        have just assumed the total price was a little more expensive this time
        around. However, as a band we decided that it was not right to keep the
        extra money and the ethical thing to do would be to email the ticket
        holders, inform them of the error and refund the extra charge.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we were weighing up the decision, we thought about integrity and how
        important it is to be honest and open in what we do to keep our band's
        reputation solid and our fans' trust intact. We wanted to be fair, so we
        owned up to the mistake and decided to give back the extra money, making
        sure our fans weren't left out of pocket. Taking responsibility was key
        for us; we admitted the error and made things right, showing that we're
        serious about being answerable for our actions and sticking to high
        ethical standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reflecting on this decision I am pleased that we decided to refund the
        extra charge. Personally, I would have felt guilty keeping money that we
        had not earned honestly. I like to think that I have a good sense of
        judgement when it comes to situations like this and after weighing up
        the options I believe we made the right choice.

        Family is an integral part of my life and I’m lucky to have inherited
        strong, positive values from them that make me who I am today. I grew up
        with my mum and a younger brother, my dad passed away when I was young
        so we lived with my grandparents until I moved away for Uni. I like to
        think of my family as embodying a work hard, play hard mentality.
        Physical activity and fitness have always played a prominent role in our
        lives and we’re lucky enough to still be able to share activities like
        surfing together. We are a social bunch and often enjoy getting together
        with our extended family for drinks, dinners and sometimes the odd
        family sing-a-long. My partner Emily and I have been together for over
        three years now and I’m forever grateful for her positivity and zest for
        life. Her encouragement and support have given me the confidence to make
        the move back to study this year. We’re also lucky that we share a lot
        of the same interests playing music and surfing together as well as a
        passion for cooking and travel.

        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Strong work ethic and determination: I began learning the basics of
          coding and web development around one year ago while still working
          full-time. As my time was limited I got into the habit of waking up at
          5 am and using the hour and a half before I had to leave for work to
          get some learning and practice in. It’s a practice and habit I’ve come
          to enjoy and has helped me to implement better time management
          throughout my life. I aim to stick to this schedule throughout my time
          at Dev Academy and use the time to practice auxiliary skills like
          typing (which I’m a little slow at) and to work on personal projects
          like redesigning a website for my friend’s landscaping business.
        </li>
        <li>
          Curiosity and enthusiasm to learn: I’m thankful that I genuinely enjoy
          the learning process and look forward to developing new skills. I’m
          hoping that this will keep me motivated throughout the course and
          drive my learning journey.
        </li>
        <li>
          Open-mindedness and flexibility: I’m aware of what I know and maybe
          even more aware of what I don’t know. Now, more than ever I’m grateful
          for my ability to keep an open mind and have my views challenged or
          changed. There’s always more than one way to solve a problem and just
          because I come up with an initial solution that feels right for me, it
          doesn’t mean that it’s the best or most appropriate for the situation.
          I’m willing to accept that I might be wrong and happy to try someone
          else’s idea or solution in place of my own. I think compromise is a
          key part of working effectively in a team.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fear of failure and mistakes: Mistakes are going to be made somewhere
          along this learning journey, and I’m not always going to get it right
          the first time. However, I need to be mindful of this and accept that
          this is all part of the process, rather than letting the fear stop me
          from making progress. I think the idea of breaking problems down into
          smaller chunks and being methodical rather than trying to speed
          through tasks should help me here.
        </li>
        <li>
          Perfectionism: I often have an idealised version of the thing I’m
          trying to create. This is great in some respects as it allows me to
          aim high and try to be the best I can possibly be. On the flip side,
          however, it can also slow me down massively as I try to strive for
          absolute perfection when sometimes it isn’t necessary. Striking a
          balance between perfectionism and efficiency will be something I focus
          on throughout my learning journey.

      <p>
        Recently my band was busy rehearsing for our last show as our singer and
        bass player are moving overseas. We've been playing together for around
        seven years now and have all become very close friends. With our final
        show looming, I was adamant that we should make the most of our last
        rehearsals and work really hard. Unfortunately life often gets in the
        way. Not everyone was able to commit to the same level of intensity and
        rehearsal schedule as I'd hoped for. Often one member would have to work
        later than expected and couldn't make it. While this was frustrating, I
        managed it by making the best of who was available at the time. In some
        ways, not having everyone present made you focus on different aspects of
        the song and performance that you might not have seen or heard had
        everyone been there. I found it beneficial to focus on these silver
        linings rather than get too disappointed at the lack of availability and
        commitment. This taught me to manage expectations and was a good lesson
        in seeing things from someone else's perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to this, because we are all such good friends the rehearsals
        can often drift into social catch-up occasions. While initially I was
        slightly annoyed at the lack of focus, I realised that sometimes it's
        better to be a bit more lenient and not to rock the boat too much in an
        effort to preserve the morale and enthusiasm of the group. Instead, I
        would slowly steer the conversation back to the task at hand and act as
        the leader rather than letting it descend into a disorganised mess.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I were to approach this situation again I could make my intentions
        clearer from the outset as to what I expected from the sessions and
        implement more structure by allocating focus time countered by more
        frequent breaks for socialising, compromise being key here.
