        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
        <h2>Stuck on a problem...</h2>
        <p>
          I was stuck on the reverse loop challenge in the last sprint. I needed
          to make the console print on separate lines: “Three!” “Two!” “One!”
          “Blast Off!”. For some reason I couldn’t wrap my head around the
          correct way to write the loop so that it would loop backwards through
          the array and print each string to the console one by one.
        </p>
        <h4>Problem solving techniques</h4>
        <p>
          I started by trying what I thought might work just to see if I might
          get lucky, if not hopefully I’d get an error or see what I was able to
          get printing to the console.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next I tried altering my code based on the results I got back from my
          failed first attempt.
        </p>
        <p>
          After this I reached out to the tech-questions channel on discord as I
          was beginning to get confused by the error message and results I was
          getting. I got some good advice back which helped me to modify my
          loop. However, it still wasn’t working perfectly..
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally I turned to chatgpt, explained what I was expecting to see and
          shared my code snippet and asked it to point out specifically where in
          the code I needed to look to change my input to receive the expected
          output. I use this as a last resort as often if the prompt isn’t
          worded correctly it will just give the answer away, diminishing my
          learning opportunity. In the end this helped me slot the final piece
          into the puzzle.
        </p>
        <h4>Reflecting on the problem</h4>
        <p>
          I felt frustrated and overwhelmed initially. I thought I’d wrapped my
          head around the basic concept of loops, and while this was true to
          some extent, I was easily tripped up by attempting to implement it in
          reverse. On top of this, the console errors didn’t seem very helpful
          and tended to confuse me more. Finally, throughout the whole process,
          as I was working with a loop it was very easy to crash the browser if
          I wrote the condition incorrectly, adding to the frustration.
        </p>
        <h4>Lessons learnt</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I learned that trial and error is a valid way to solve a problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            I learned that breaking the problem down into parts can help me
            focus on one piece at a time rather than letting the whole problem
            overwhelm me.
          </li>
          <li>It’s better to ask for help sooner, rather than later.</li>
          <li>
            Chat GPT is useful and very powerful but can sometimes give too much
            away in a learning environment unless given specific instruction.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>An elegant solution</h2>
        <p>
          In page scrolling on my personal blog. I wanted to have a basic
          navigation bar where a link button called “BLOG” would scroll down to
          the section of the page where I listed my blog links. I knew I had to
          use an <code><a></a></code> tag for the link but wasn’t sure the best
          way of linking within the same page.
        </p>
        <p>
          I googled “In page linking HTML CSS” and read through a few examples.
          It seemed using an ID for the section I wanted to navigate to would be
          the best bet. I got it to work but it wasn’t perfect, it was snapping
          to the very top of the screen and was too abrupt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of trying to get everything working at once I focused in on
          creating some offset so that the section title wasn’t snapping to the
          top of the page. Again I did some googling here and implemented my
          findings by writing a css rule to add scroll-margin-top to the
          section.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I got that working I googled smooth scrolling as I had a hunch
          that was what I needed to use to stop it jumping so abruptly. I didn’t
          know how to write the css rule however so needed some context and
          examples before writing it into my css file.
        </p>
        <h4>Reflecting on the process</h4>
        <p>
          This felt much more empowering, I had a clear plan of what I wanted to
          achieve and was able to break the problem down into steps to avoid
          overwhelming myself. While I couldn’t exactly try random css rules to
          see if they worked, I had a fair idea of what to google and knew what
          I wanted to see as an outcome. I was glad I was able to achieve it on
          my own without reaching out for external help via discord or chat gpt.
        </p>
        <h4>Lessons learnt</h4>
        <p>
          I learned how to link and scroll to different sections within a
          webpage using html IDs and css rules for scroll-margin and smooth
          scrolling. In terms of problem solving, I learned to trust my
          intuition and give it a go.
        </p>
        <h2>Reflecting on different problem solving techniques</h2>
        <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
        <p>
          I’ve gotten better at using this in the JavaScript cafe stretch
          challenges. I’d say I’m about a 6 or 7/10 with confidence here. The
          main thing holding me back is not knowing how to describe the steps to
          achieve the desired outcome clearly enough.
        </p>
        <h4>Trying Something</h4>
        <p>
          I’m fairly confident with this too, maybe a 6 or 7/10 again. The main
          issue holding me back here is the uncertainty of exactly where to
          start worrying about failure and confusing myself.
        </p>
        <h4>Rubber Ducky Method</h4>
        <p>
          I’m a little unfamiliar with this method and haven’t used it much yet.
        </p>
        <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
        <p>
          I’m ok with reading error messages and can generally figure out where
          it’s trying to point out an error, however, I often find the message
          itself a bit confusing and sometimes not very helpful.
        </p>
        <h4>Console.log</h4>
        <p>
          I want to get better at console.logging. I’m still confused as to
          where and when is the best time to console.log and what to ask it. I
          used it a bit in the JS Olympics however, I need to practice this more
          and implement it in the next challenges.
        </p>
        <h4>Googling</h4>
        <p>
          I’m confident with googling when I have a problem, however, sometimes
          I don’t know the method or name of the thing I’m trying to ask for.
        </p>
        <h4>Asking peers for help</h4>
        <p>
          I’m confident asking peers for help and feel like I know how to ask
          the right questions and how to link my code properly.
        </p>
        <h4>Asking Coaches for help</h4>
        <p>
          Again, same as above. I would add chat GPT in here too and say I’m
          getting more confident in asking it to act as a tutor to help expand
          and explain a problem for me without giving the answer away.
        </p>
        <h4>Improving my process with reflection</h4>
        <p>
          I think I could do better here, sometimes I find it hard to recall
          what I did to get the result. I think I could try to review some of my
          code and note down what I have learned to keep on top of this.
        </p>
        <h2>Reflecting on a time I was reluctant to ask for help</h2>
        <p>
          Often I’m reluctant to ask for help when I feel like the problem is
          small enough that I should be able to solve it on my own. I think this
          reluctance comes from a little bit of embarrassment and pride that I
          should be better. I still think giving the problem a good honest crack
          on my own is the first thing I should do, however, I need to realise
          that it is ok to ask for help and not feel embarrassed even if it
          seems like a small problem. Sometimes you just need a fresh set of
          eyes on it!
